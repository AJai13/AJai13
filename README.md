### Hello 👋
My name is Adam Zanetti and I'm currently a hairdresser. 

Yeah, I know, you're asking yourself what I'm doing here, right?

Well, I like making people happy and look pretty, but I also love languages and technology, so I got back to college in order to learn more about programming and related stuff. :wink:


- 🔭 I’m currently working on studying to become a software engineer. lol
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, MySQL and Python.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any game related project (but only when I get better at programming).
- 💬 Ask me about cats, animes and JRPGs.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/_justfakeit) ..although I barely tweet anything, I regurlarly check my DMs

- ⚡ Fun fact: No one gets my age right. I bet you can't either :sunglasses:
